## Usage Examples

### Basic Team Collaboration

```python
from app.agents.team_collaboration import VexelTeamCollaboration

# Create team system
team = VexelTeamCollaboration(
    team_name="ProjectTeam",
    mode="coordinate",
    user_id="user_123"
)

# Execute task
response = team.run_team_task(
    "Research and analyze the benefits of AI in healthcare"
)

print(response)
```

### Research Team

```python
from app.agents.team_collaboration import create_research_team

# Create specialized research team
research_team = create_research_team(
    team_name="HealthcareResearch",
    user_id="researcher_456",
    knowledge_sources=[{
        "type": "text",
        "name": "healthcare_data",
        "content": ["Healthcare AI research papers..."]
    }]
)

# Execute research task
result = research_team.run_team_task(
    "Find the latest developments in AI-powered diagnostic tools"
)
```

### Async Collaboration

```python
import asyncio

async def run_async_team():
    team = VexelTeamCollaboration(
        team_name="AsyncTeam",
        mode="collaborate"
    )
    
    response = await team.arun_team_task(
        "Analyze market opportunities for AI products"
    )
    
    return response

result = asyncio.run(run_async_team())
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Required
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key

# Optional
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key
QDRANT_URL=http://localhost:6333
```

### Database Setup

The system uses SQLite for persistent storage:

- **Team Sessions**: `vexel_team_sessions` table
- **Team Memories**: `vexel_team_memories` table
- **Knowledge Storage**: Qdrant vector database

### Knowledge Sources

```python
knowledge_sources = [
    {
        "type": "text",
        "name": "domain_knowledge",
        "content": [
            "Domain-specific information...",
            "Expert insights and data...",
            "Historical context and trends..."
        ]
    }
]
```

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Tips

1. **Knowledge Base Size**: Limit knowledge content for faster processing
2. **Team Size**: 4 specialized agents provide optimal balance
3. **Model Selection**: Use appropriate models for different tasks
4. **Memory Management**: Regular cleanup of old memories
5. **Async Operations**: Use async methods for better performance

### Monitoring

- **Success Criteria**: Define clear completion conditions
- **Response Times**: Monitor team coordination overhead
- **Memory Usage**: Track memory creation and retrieval
- **Agent Performance**: Monitor individual agent contributions

## Testing

### Unit Tests

```bash
# Run team collaboration tests
python test_team_collaboration.py
```

### API Tests

```bash
# Test basic functionality
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/agents/team-collaboration/test"

# Test research team
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/agents/team-collaboration/create-research-team" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"task": "Research AI trends", "user_id": "test_user"}'
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Knowledge Loading Fails**: Check Qdrant connection and Gemini API key
2. **Team Creation Errors**: Verify all required dependencies are installed
3. **Memory Issues**: Clear old memories or increase database limits
4. **API Timeouts**: Increase timeout limits for complex tasks

### Debug Mode

Enable debug mode for detailed logging:

```python
team = VexelTeamCollaboration(
    team_name="DebugTeam",
    mode="coordinate",
    debug_mode=True
)
```

## Next Steps
