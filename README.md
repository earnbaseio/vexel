## üí° What is Vexel?

Vexel is an open-source framework designed to simplify the creation, deployment, and management of intelligent AI agents. It provides a robust, scalable, and safe foundation (the **Vector**) so you can focus on building brilliant, task-specific agents (the **Pixels**).

Whether you're automating complex workflows, building conversational AI, or exploring autonomous systems, Vexel gives you the tools to do it efficiently and reliably.

## üé® The Philosophy: Vector + Pixel

Our name and philosophy are inspired by "Vexel Art," a digital art form that blends the scalability of vectors with the detail of pixels.

* **Vector (The Platform):** The core of Vexel is built with Rust, offering the performance, safety, and concurrency of a vector-based foundation. It's structured, logical, and infinitely scalable.
* **Pixel (The Agents):** On this foundation, you craft your agents. Each agent is a "pixel"‚Äîa detailed, functional unit designed for a specific purpose. Together, they form a complex and intelligent picture.

**In short: Vexel provides the solid structure so you can create the brilliant details.**

## üöÄ Get Started in 5 Minutes

### Prerequisites

* [Rust and Cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (latest stable version).

### 1. Create a New Project

```bash
cargo new my_vexel_agent
cd my_vexel_agent
```

### 2. Add Vexel to `Cargo.toml`

```toml
[dependencies]
vexel = "0.1.0"  # Use the latest version from crates.io
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
async-trait = "0.1"
```

### 3. Write Your First Agent (`src/main.rs`)

```rust
use vexel::{Agent, Context, Task, TaskResult};
use async_trait::async_trait;

// Define a simple agent struct
struct MyAgent;

// Implement the Agent trait
#[async_trait]
impl Agent for MyAgent {
    async fn run(&self, mut context: Context) -> TaskResult {
        println!("Hello from MyAgent!");
        context.log("The agent has started its main task.");
        
        // Your agent's logic goes here
        
        context.log("Agent run completed successfully.");
        Ok(())
    }
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let agent = MyAgent;
    let context = Context::new("my-first-agent");

    println!("Dispatching agent...");
    if let Err(e) = agent.run(context).await {
        eprintln!("Agent encountered an error: {}", e);
    } else {
        println!("Agent finished its mission.");
    }
}
```

### 4. Run the Agent

```bash
cargo run
```

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap
