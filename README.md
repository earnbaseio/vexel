**Vexel** is a high-performance, developer-first agent platform built in Rust. It provides a robust framework (the **Vector**) for you to architect, deploy, and manage intelligent, fine-grained AI agents (the **Pixels**).

## ‚ú® Key Features

* üöÄ **High Performance:** Built on Rust for blazing-fast execution and memory safety, ensuring your agents run efficiently.
* üõ°Ô∏è **Robust & Scalable:** A solid architectural foundation designed to handle everything from a single agent to a large-scale, multi-agent system.
* üß© **Modular by Design:** Easily compose, reuse, and extend agent capabilities. Create complex behaviors from simple, reusable components.
* ‚öôÔ∏è **Developer-First API:** A clean, intuitive, and powerful API that gets out of your way and lets you focus on building agent logic.
* üåê **Powered by Agno:** Leverages the battle-tested [Agno framework](https://github.com/agno-agi/agno) for core agent functionalities.

## üé® Our Philosophy: Vector + Pixel

The name **Vexel** embodies our core philosophy, inspired by the digital art form that combines the best of two worlds:

* **Vector (The Platform):** The core of Vexel is our Rust-based framework. It represents the mathematical precision, infinite scalability, and logical structure of vector graphics. This is the solid, dependable foundation upon which everything is built.

* **Pixel (The Agents):** On top of this foundation, you create the "pixels"‚Äîyour intelligent agents. Each agent is a detailed, specific, and functional unit that performs a task. Like pixels in a Vexel artwork, your agents can be combined to create a rich, complex, and intelligent system.

**Vexel gives you a powerful Vector foundation to craft brilliant Pixel agents.**

## üöÄ Getting Started
